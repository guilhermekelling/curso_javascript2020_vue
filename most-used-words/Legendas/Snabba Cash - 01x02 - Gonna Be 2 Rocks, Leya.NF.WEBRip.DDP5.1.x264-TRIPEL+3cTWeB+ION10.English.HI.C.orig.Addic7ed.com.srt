- Hey, Tomas.
- [Tomas] <i>Hey.</i>

169
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,400
<i>Right now I'm over in Singapore
for a a board meeting,</i>

170
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,480
<i>so I won't be able
to stay on for very long.</i>

171
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,400
Okay.

172
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,560
[Tomas] <i>These beautiful people
are the Macking investment committee.</i>

173
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,160
<i>Hassan you've already met.</i>

174
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,200
<i>- Martin over there is our tech guy.</i>
- Oh.

175
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,160
- Nice to meet you.
<i>- And Li is in charge of the legal side.</i>

176
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,360
[Leya] Hi. Nice to meet you.

177
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,880
<i>Uh, for me, you know, it's important
that I don't invest in random companies.</i>

178
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,200
<i>You see, I always want
a win-win situation.</i>

179
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,440
<i>That means I always try
and embrace my companies.</i>

180
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,720
<i>Grab them and squeeze them dry while
making sure everybody walks away a winner.</i>

181
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,456
- I get what you're saying.
- [Tomas] <i>Great.</i>

182
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,400
<i>All right.
The Chinese guy's here. I'd better go.</i>

183
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,640
<i>- Leya?</i>
- Yes.

184
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,560
<i>- Lock this in. All right?</i>
- You got it.

185
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,440
- [Tomas] <i>Then we'll do business.</i>
- Yes.

186
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,960
<i>That's what I like to hear from you.
Knock 'em dead.</i>

187
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,120
<i>- Chip, chop, ping, pong.</i>
- [Martin] Leya?

188
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,040
[Leya] Yeah?

189
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,360
I have a few thoughts
on your data integration here.

190
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,080
And the machine learning element
could definitely be better.

191
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,680
I don't think it has to be.

192
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,680
Oh, that's him. Oh, for fuck's sake.

193
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,640
- This guy here seems sharp. [laughs]
- Yeah, Vlad's a real star.

194
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,560
[Martin]
I'm giving my recommend to go ahead.

195
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,520
I wouldn't do that just yet.
We have a huge problem here.

196
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,800
- [Martin] What's wrong this time?
- Problem? What kind of problem?

197
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,960
There's absolutely no way
Tomas Storm is going to be part of this

198
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,280
with someone like Marcus Werner.

199
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,920
Oh, that.

200
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,040
I'm in the process of buying him out.
The deal has basically been worked out.

201
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
[tense music playing]

202
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,680
Come. We have to talk.

203
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,720
[Viktoria sighs]

204
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,960
"It's pretty much done?"
Are you kidding me?

205
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,080
I mean, listen, Viktoria.
What was I supposed to do?

206
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,360
You heard what she said.

207
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,080
Tomas won't get on board
as long as Marcus Werner's in the picture.

208
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,080
Yeah, chill out.

209
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,200
- Can you get Werner out?
- Of course.

210
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,840
- How?
- I'll buy him out.

211
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,080
For how much? One million crowns, or what?

212
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,320
One and a half million crowns.

213
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,120
- But I got this.
- I hope so.

214
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
[door closes]

215
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,000
[sighs]

216
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,960
- [woman] Thank you.
- [Said] No worries.

217
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,280
- [Leya] I need to talk to you.
- Sure.

218
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,520
- Did you pick? Just give me one minute.
- Yeah.

219
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,800
- My company needs a little bit of money.
- So does everybody these days.

220
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,320
But now I have a real investor. That guy,
Tomas Storm. You've heard of him.

221
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,840
- [Said] No.
- He's really great.

222
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,440
He won't help until I own the company.

223
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,120
That means I have to buy out
the other guy, the investor from earlier.

224
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,880
Right. Good.
That way, you'll be your own boss.

225
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,160
Oh, where is that box
for the pick-up order?

226
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,480
- [man] Here.
- Thanks.

227
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,720
I was wondering
if you'd loan me some money.

228
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,000
Loan you money?

229
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,080
Uh, yeah. Yeah. How much do you need?

230
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,000
- [Leya] How much do you have?
- A decent amount. How much?

231
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,440
But it will take a while.
It's in a Lebanese bank account.

232
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,840
Number 12 and number 38.

233
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,520
- That'll be 215 crowns.
- Said. Said!

234
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,640
- Why is he here?
- [Said] What?

235
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,800
He's a nice guy.

236
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,480
Come on! Then go over there
and give him your number.

237
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
What does he need my number for, huh?

238
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,080
Just go over there. Stop it.

239
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,640
Are you stalking me?

240
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
What?

241
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,520
I just got some lunch.
I didn't know you worked here.

242
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,000
Pff! Sure!

243
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,400
[Salim]
Okay, just chill for a second. Hold on.

244
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
A little.

245
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,720
A little, huh?

246
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
I was stalking you a little.

247
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,320
I wanted to see you again, okay?

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,320
Well, you found me.

249
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,000
[laughs softly]

250
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,960
[Sami] Mom.

251
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,360
[Leya] Sami, you can't be here.
Stay in the kitchen. Come on.

252
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
[Sami] But my game's not working.

253
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,080
[indistinct chatter]

254
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,160
[Leya] Said.

255
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
[Said] Yeah.

256
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
I'm gonna need
one and a half million crowns.

257
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,080
- One and a half million crowns?
- Ssh!

258
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,480
I won't be able to get you that.

259
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,640
Listen, I could get you, uh,
a hundred thousand crowns.

260
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,520
But you have that house in Lebanon.

261
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,360
The house is for my daughter, Leya.
I can't just...

262
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,120
[indistinct chatter]

263
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,800
Where's Sami? Sami?

264
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,280
[sighs]

265
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,120
[Sami] Here.

266
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,640
- [Salim] Okay.
- [Sami] That one.

267
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,720
- [Leya] I'm so sorry. Sami, come on...
- No, it's fine. He can stay if he wants.

268
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,640
- This one goes here.
- Come on. Sit down. Sit.

269
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,280
- [Sami] And that one...
- [Salim] He just came right over to me.

270
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,760
Now we're best friends forever.
Right, Sami?

271
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,920
- Yeah.
- Yeah. [chuckles]

272
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You're lucky. He doesn't like everybody.

273
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,960
- [Sami] Now it's done.
- You finished it? Wow!

274
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,560
- Then you can make it do this.
- Yeah?

275
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,680
I'm the kid whisperer.

276
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,120
[laughs]

277
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,960
[Salim] I used to watch
my little brothers and sisters in Syria.

278
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,240
That was tough.

279
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,400
[Sami] Then if you press this one,
you can change it to winter.

280
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,440
Sorry about how I acted
on the phone earlier,

281
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,960
but you were calling me
in the middle of a big work thing.

282
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,160
But I can't start dating. Not right now.

283
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,320
That's too bad.

284
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,080
I guess that means I'll have
to eat here to hang out with you.

285
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,480
At that point, I'll call the police
to report you for stalking.

286
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,880
[Salim] Why?
Then I'll report you right back.

287
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,800
For what?

288
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,680
For... I don't know.
Because you reported me.

289
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,200
[both laugh]

290
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,520
- [cell phone ringing]
- Now if you go here...

291
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,160
I have to take this.

292
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,360
What is it, bro?

293
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,320
What is it?

294
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,160
We found that little motherfucker Amir.

295
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,600
Dani's runner. Guy who popped Ari.

296
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,880
<i>Meet us at Skärholmen central.
It's all set up. Get in, get out.</i>

297
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,560
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. What?

298
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,600
<i>Yo, Salim, don't mess with me.
Get here now.</i>

299
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,880
You're gonna finish this.
It's now or never.

300
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,720
Understand? This is it. Get to it.

301
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,360
Chill out, okay?

302
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,240
Yeah, all right. Coming.

303
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
<i>Good.</i>

304
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,840
[sighs] Fuck.

305
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,760
Leya, I'm heading out.

306
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,240
- Okay.
- [Salim] Thanks for a lovely date.

307
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,280
- It wasn't a date.
- [Salim] Well, it felt like a date to me.

308
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,440
Take care, bro, okay?

309
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,120
Give me a fist bump. See you.

310
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,800
[Nala] Hey, the snitch was right.

311
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,480
He's still in there with his girl
at the restaurant.

312
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,000
- You sure that's the guy that killed Ari?
- One hundred per cent, bro.

313
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,560
I'll fucking destroy him.

314
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,520
[Ravy] Okay, listen up.
You pop that boy right in his face

315
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,000
so even his mom can't ID the body.

316
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,840
I'll make it right. Plus, he knows us.

317
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,480
[man] Hey, give me a kiss.

318
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Come on!

319
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,880
- [man laughs]
- [kissing]

320
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
[Salim breathing heavily]

321
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,080
[couple laughing]

322
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,520
Fuck!

323
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,560
- Did you get him?
- Fuck!

324
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,120
He's a piece of shit! I swear to God!

325
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,080
- Salim, what happened?
- I almost had the guy, he hopped in a car.

326
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,320
[tuts] Dude, are you serious?

327
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,520
I couldn't line up the shot.

328
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,440
How could you miss?
Just take the fucking shot! Are you dumb?

329
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,320
I said fuck him up,
not fuck the whole thing up, bro.

330
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
[Ravy] Come on.

331
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,040
What was that about?

332
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,240
I didn't have the shot.

333
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
I swear, man. And then the guy was gone.

334
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
What do you mean?

335
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,040
What do I mean? He hopped in some car
and was gone. What else could I do?

336
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,720
Who was he with?

337
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,880
He was alone.

338
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,960
[tense music playing]

339
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,880
[Salim] Bro...

340
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,000
Listen. Next time, he's dead.

341
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,560
Don't give up on me yet, bro.

342
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Okay?

343
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,880
[tense music continues]

344
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,640
I didn't do anything.
You know, he jumped me.

345
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,560
[officer]
Well, that's not what they say happened.

346
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,400
Okay. So what do they say happened?

347
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,520
Well, that Tim here
came and tried to rob their store.

348
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,880
No, I didn't.

349
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,080
I went to buy a snack at the store,
that man yelled at me,

350
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,840
said I couldn't use a card
and that I was white trash.

351
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,120
Then he punched me, and I ran.

352
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,320
[game voice] <i>Police are incoming...</i>

353
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
[gunfire]

354
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,240
You don't believe me?

355
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,760
Hey, listen. Of course I believe you.

356
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,960
I know you.

357
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,560
I know that you would never ever
do anything like this.

358
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,280
But these are
very serious allegations here, bud.

359
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,040
[Tim] Yeah, but they aren't true.

360
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,280
Listen, Tim, I'll help.

361
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,760
You won't have to go through this alone.

362
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,240
When the cops asked me,
you didn't say anything.

363
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,600
[dad] What do you mean? What would I say?

364
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,080
Why are you such a pussy?

365
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,480
I guess you're a big wimp, huh?
No wonder Mom left your sorry ass.

366
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,160
[video game continues playing]

367
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,960

[cell phone ringing]

369
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,840
- This is Leya.
<i>- Hi, this is Hassan.</i>

370
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,600
<i>Listen,
Tomas Storm wants to see you today.</i>

371
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,880
[Leya] Okay. Um...

372
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,640
<i>Tomas has some time later today.
You'll be back home by tonight.</i>

373
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,560
Okay. Uh...

374
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,520
<i>This is an opportunity you don't want
to pass up. I'll pick you up in an hour.</i>

375
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,440
Hm-mm.

376
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,240
<i>- Great. See you later.</i>
- Okay, yes. Great.

377
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,040
You're fucking joking! That's...

378
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,160
Hey. Hey, listen.
Can you watch Sami today?

379
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Okay.

380
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,080
Okay. Hope it's fine. Thanks anyway.

381
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,840
- Talk later.
- [Sami] Mom!

382
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,200
Fuck!

383
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,720
- Hey, Mom.
<i>- Hey, sweetheart. I'm at work.</i>

384
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,200
<i>Double shift today. I can't really talk.</i>

385
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,120
[blows] Okay.

386
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
- <i>Everything okay?</i>
- Uh...

387
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,280
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

388
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,120
Okay, bye.
We'll talk later. Okay, love you. [sighs]

389
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
- [Sami] Mom!
- Yeah, okay. Mama's coming.

390
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,120
- One sec.
- [Sami] Mom, I'm hungry.

391
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
[doorbell rings]

392
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
[sighs]

393
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,160

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,680
[sighs] Oh, dammit!

397
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,080
- [Leya] Hey.
- Hey.

398
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,240
[Leya] Thanks for coming.

399
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,120
[Leya] I shouldn't be gone very long.
I'll be back sometime later tonight.

400
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,480
Where are you going?

401
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,760
[Leya] Uh...

402
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,880
Honestly, I don't know.

403
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,160
Um, this big investor called me,
and he might want to invest in my company.

404
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,200
So thanks for this.
I know it's last minute, so...

405
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,840
If you really want to date a single mom,
this is as sexy as it's gonna get.

406
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,440
Me and Sami will have fun.

407
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,320
- Hey, Sami.
- [Sami] Hey.

408
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,160
- [Salim] What's up?
- [Sami] Nothing.

409
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,440
[Salim] Good. Come on,
show me our handshake.

410
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,400
Oh!

411
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,280
- [Salim] Boom! What are you building?
- Just some stairs.

412
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,400
[Salim] Some stairs, huh?
Where are they gonna lead to?

413
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,000
[sighs] Doesn't matter. Just some stairs.

414
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,720
[Leya] Here's his iPad.

415
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,880
- Mom has to go to work now.
- Hm-mm.

416
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,960
You already know Salim.
You guys get to hang out. Isn't that cool?

417
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,680
Yeah, it's gonna be really fun.
Give me some sugar.

418
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,520
See you soon.

419
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,800
[Sami] You go here.

420
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,000
That's right. There's drinks, um...

421
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,360
There's some drinks in the fridge
if you guys want.

422
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,120
And he loves pizza. Hawaiian pizza.

423
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,640
If you want to score a few points,

424
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,360
you could get him
a Hawaiian pizza or something.

425
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
[Salim] Absolutely.

426
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,240
Thanks for doing this for me.
It means a lot.

427
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,040
Good luck.

428
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,920
- Later, Sami.
- [Sami] Bye, Mom.

429
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,000
[Salim] Want to watch something?

430
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,080
[traffic hums]

431
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,240
[helicopter overhead]

432
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,360
Put your seat belt on.

433
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,160
- Where are we going?
- We're going to see Tomas.

434
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,040
Right now he's at a silent retreat,
but he wants to talk to you.

435
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,560
[atmospheric music playing]

436
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,640
[Sami humming]

437
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,720
[continues humming]

438
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,360
[Salim] Well, where could he be?
Maybe he's inside the oven?

439
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,000
No!

440
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,400
[Sami humming]

441
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,720
[Salim]
I think he might be in the bathroom.

442
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,920
Yeah, I'll just go check
the bathroom then.

443
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,680
Ay! [laughs] Hey!

444
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,480
- [Salim] Where's the ball?
- There it is!

445
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,280
- [Salim] Okay, grab it. [laughs]
- [Sami laughs]

446
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,320
[Salim] Take it, then.
Okay, here's a question.

447
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,800
- Ronaldo or Messi?
- [Sami] Messi.

448
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,160
No, man. Ronaldo!

449
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,960
- No, Messi!
- Have you seen Ronaldo's free kicks?

450
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,200
- [Sami laughs] Like this?
- [Salim] Not that wide. A little bit less.

451
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,440
There. That's perfect. Stand over here.

452
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,480
Okay, listen.

453
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,840
I'll throw the ball,
and whoever catches it first, wins.

454
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
- Ready?
- Hm-mm.

455
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,360
[Salim] Okay, let's go!

456
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,440
Go long! Get it! Go! Go! Go!

457
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,360
Oh, man! You're so fast!

458
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,760
Wow, you're too good at this, man.

459
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,440
- [Sami] These bushes have thorns in them.
- [Salim] They've got thorns, huh?

460
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,240
- [breathes heavily] Sami?
- [Sami] Yeah?

461
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,360
All right. Come back.
Hey, come back here. Sami, come.

462
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,680
- [Sami] Hm-mm.
- [Salim] Come. Hurry up. Leave the ball.

463
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,240
Here. Come on. Take my hand.

464
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,640
Come on. <i>Yalla, yalla.</i>
We've got to go home, okay?

465
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,840
- Is that okay?
- [Sami] Yes.

466
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,280
Dani.

467
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,640
I've got that fucking asshole Salim here.

468
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,920
- I'll race you home now. Are you ready?
- [Sami] Yeah.

469
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,480
[Salim] Okay. Go, go, go, go, go!
You're so fast!

470
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,520
[Salim panting]

471
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,000
This way. Come on. Run!

472
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,600
Hurry, Sami.

473
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,240
[tense music playing]

474
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,760
- Are you good to walk?
- Hm-mm.

475
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,520
[Salim] Go, go, go!

476
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,760
Jump. Hold my hand.
Hold my hand. Hold my hand.

477
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,240
[both panting]

478
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,320
Come on. Keep up!

479
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,320
Come.

480
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,640
[Sami groans]

481
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
[Salim] Got you.

482
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,640
- Hey. Listen, mate...
- Hey. Welcome.

483
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,520
- [man] What can I get you?
- We need a favor.

484
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,680
Tell me what you need.

485
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
[engine revving]

486
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,040
[man] Are you guys ready?

487
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,840
[ominous music playing]

488
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,160
Go upstairs and check there.

489
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,600
Hey, guys. Welcome.

490
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,120
- [man] Where did he go?
- [shopkeeper] Who?

491
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,960
[man] The guy who just came in here.

492
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,880
He just passed through.

493
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,760
Do you want to order?

494
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,120
You hear something there?

495
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
I don't think so.

496
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,520
[man 2] Hey, yo! There's a back door here!

497
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,960
That piece of shit!

498
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,040
[man 2] I'll check the alley.

499
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,200
[man 3]
Don't worry. We'll get that bitch.

500
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,960
[music playing over speakers]

501
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,280
[Salim] Found you!

502
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,560
[panting]

503
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,000
- Was that fun?
- Yeah.

504
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,200
Yeah? Okay.

505
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,120
Ready to go home?

506
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,240
- [Sami] Hm-mm.
- [Salim] Yeah.

507
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,080
- Thank you, brother.
- No problem.

508
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,800
- Be careful out there.
- Thanks.

509
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,640
- [Leya] Hi.
- Hi.

510
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
What are you doing?

511
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,680
Well, this is a silent retreat which means
I'm not speaking even when I'm alone.

512
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,440
- [Leya] Okay. How's that going?
- It's going all right.

513
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,920
Right now there's a meditation.
Then we have a break where we drink tea.

514
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,160
Now, then.

515
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,440
They're telling me you need
eight million crowns to break even.

516
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,040
[Leya] Yeah, but that's still
excluding marketing expenses.

517
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,320
[Tomas] Hm.

518
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,480
Why don't we make it 25?

519
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,080
So that way,
you can really hit the ground running.

520
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
[Leya] Uh...

521
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,600
Twenty-five million crowns?

522
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,520
- Uh, yeah, I'll hit the ground running.
- [Tomas] Glad to hear it.

523
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,520
So, I want us to go live on Macking
in six months.

524
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,120
Sure. That means there'll be a few numbers
to crunch, but that won't be a problem.

525
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,160
I want a perfect stock market launch.

526
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,240
So, then it is true?
You're planning an IPO?

527
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,880
[Tomas] It's a done deal,
but it's not quite official yet.

528
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,520
But do you think you'd like
to be a part of this adventure?

529
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,520
[Leya] Yeah. Are you kidding? Of course.

530
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,280
- So, you're with me?
- [Leya] Yeah.

531
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,360
[Tomas] Hm.

532
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,920
Make sure you get rid of that loser
Werner, or else I'm out of the picture.

533
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,280
- Yeah.
- [Tomas] Can you do that?

534
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,880
Yes. I'm buying him out now.

535
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
[Tomas] Good.

536
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,360
I'm staying quiet!

537
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,520
Really glad you could come!

538
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,240
[Nala] What's up, guys?

539
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,200
Come. We need to speak. Come on.

540
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,120
With who?

541
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,960
[Nala] Tsk! "Who"?
That homeboy behind you.

542
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,080
Nah, you, dog.

543
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,880
<i>Yalla.</i> Get moving, kid.

544
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
Hop in.

545
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
- Want a drink?
- [Tim] No, thanks.

546
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,360
- You sure?
- [pops can]

547
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,800
[Nala sighs]

548
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,800
[Nala] So, then... did you trash that store?

549
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
Yeah.

550
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,080
- [Nala snickers]
- [man laughs]

551
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,760
- [man] You fucking did it, bro.
- [Nala laughing] Hey, man.

552
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,160
- Oh, my God!
- Well...

553
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,880
[Nala] Hey, we were just messing with you.

554
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,080
[man laughing]

555
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,880
- [man] That's fuckin' insane, bro.
- Should have seen your face! Oh, my God!

556
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,880
- [man] Yeah, that's right.
- [Nala] I'm glad. You did good.

557
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,040
- That cocksucker deserved it.
- [man] But the cops caught you?

558
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
[Tim] Yeah.

559
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,960
- You say anything?
- No, I didn't say anything.

560
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,920
- [man] Are you sure?
- Yeah, not a word. I swear.

561
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Good, man.

562
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,880
[Nala] You still owe us money,
so you're gonna make a delivery.

563
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,600
Here. Take this metro card.

564
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
[man] Here.

565
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,000
[Nala] I'll text you the address
and the door code.

566
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,240
You just get in and out.
No stalling. You don't want to stay.

567
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,760
In and out like Snapchat.
You're there and gone.

568
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,360
[Tim] Hm-mm.

569
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,320
For sure. What's in the bags?

570
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,880
[Nala scoffs] If you don't know that,

571
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,480
you gotta be dumb.
I don't know what to say.

572
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
[boy] What?

573
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,440
[door buzzes]

574
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,360

[thumping music playing]

578
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,400
[woman] Thanks you. Here you go.

579
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,040
[Tim] Thanks.

580
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,680
[Nala] She thinks I give a shit.
Let's see. Damn.

581
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,280
Hey. Hey. How you doing?

582
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,280
Are you daydreaming, dude? Money!

583
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,080
Oh. Yeah, here.

584
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,520
All right. That means we're cool.

585
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,320
[man] What are you waiting for? Get lost.

586
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,840
Um, what if I helped you again?
Then I'd make some more dough?

587
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,000
[man laughs]

588
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,200
Do your folks not pay your allowance?

589
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,240
Yeah, but I want more cash.

590
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,760
- [man] He's a a fucking Swede, dog.
- Bro.

591
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,440
That's the point. He's a white kid.

592
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,640
The cops won't look twice at him, bro.
I swear, this kid will make us money, fam.

593
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,760
Give him a burner. Listen.

594
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,720
Just keep it close, all right?

595
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,680
When it rings, always pick up, 24/7.

596
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
See ya.

597
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,600
[Salim] Oh.

598
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,840
- [Leya] Hey.
- Hey. I didn't see you come in.

599
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,320
[lighter clicks]

600
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,640
[Leya] I really appreciate you doing this.

601
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,400
That you would come here

602
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
to help me out.

603
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,200
I wouldn't leave my kid
with somebody that I really didn't trust.

604
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,400
I know it must have still
seemed like that.

605
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,360
You seem cool, I guess.

606
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
Thanks.

607
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,680
- Am I your new nanny, huh?
- [Leya chuckles]

608
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,160
- [Leya] I guess so.
- Nanny Salim.

609
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,720
Well, we got a Hawaiian pizza.

610
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,280
After that, we did some soccer for a bit.

611
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,680
Played hide and seek with him too.

612
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,120
- [Leya] Hide and seek? Okay.
- Yeah.

613
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,960
Okay. Who won that?

614
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,960
Me, of course.

615
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,400
- [laughs]
- He really needs to get better.

616
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,760
But I'll train him right.

617
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,360
I mean, he's a little boy.

618
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,400
- Yeah, but so what?
- [laughs]

619
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,000
[sighs]

620
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,440
[Salim] How did it go today?

621
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,200
I think it went fine.

622
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,400
- I talked to that investor, so...
- Oh.

623
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,000
But I'm still figuring out a few things.

624
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,080
Plus, I need one and a half million crowns
to buy out a previous investor,

625
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,960
and I have no idea how to get it.
[inhales sharply]

626
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,280
It'll all work out for you.
And money won't be an issue.

627
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,760
You know a lot of people with money,
don't you?

628
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,400
[scoffs]

629
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,800
Yeah, I guess, but...

630
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,400
They are the kind of people
who were born with money.

631
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,760
They're all pretty spoiled.

632
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,160
All right. I guess I should leave.

633
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,560
Yeah, I guess you'd better.
I have to get some sleep.

634
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,920
Thanks for another date.

635
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,080
- All right. See you later.
- Yeah, all right.

636
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,400
So, if you ever need someone
to babysit again, I'll be here anytime.

[indistinct chatter]

642
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,600
[man] What's your plan?

643
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,360
[Ravy] We wait for him outside.
I told you that from the start.

644
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,560
[Leya] Ravy.

645
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,200
[woman] Chill out, bro. Please.

646
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,520
- I have to talk to you.
- What's up?

647
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,800
- I need to borrow some money.
- How much money you need?

648
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,400
One and a half million crowns.

649
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,720
Clean?

650
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,200
- Clean.
- Two million dollars clean, Leya.

651
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,800
- When do you need it?
- Tomorrow.

652
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,160
And I get to see Sami?

653
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,840
Look, we're family, right?

654
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
Yeah, sure.

655
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,360
Okay.

656
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,760
Come by tomorrow. We'll sort it out.

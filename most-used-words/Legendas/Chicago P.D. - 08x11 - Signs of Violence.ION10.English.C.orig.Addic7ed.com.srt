1
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:13,491
- Mm.
- Morning.

2
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:15,493
Morning.

3
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:20,368
You know what today is, right?

4
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:22,413
- Mm.
- RDO.

5
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:24,415
Oh, this is what a day off feels like.

6
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:27,505
You want some coffee?

7
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:29,246
I want you,

8
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,856
and then I want coffee,

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,120
and then I want waffles,

10
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:35,339
and then I want to go to the range

11
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:37,820
and try out those new .44 mags.

12
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:40,083
I love all that.

13
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:44,194
I love you.

14
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:53,575
Um, just one sec.

15
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:55,490
I'll be right back.

16
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,390
Hey, I forgot that
I was gonna take my car in,

17
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:28,566
and I just talked to them,
and they can still take me,

18
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,525
and so I'm gonna go
before they get busy.

19
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:31,743
Really?

20
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:33,832
One day off, you know?

21
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:35,182
Hailey.

22
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:37,140
I just feel like I should get it done,

23
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:39,403
but everything's fine.

24
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:43,277
Um, I'm sorry, but I... um,

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,496
stay here. I'll be right back.

26
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,889
And yeah, just hang out here,

27
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:48,891
and I'll be back in a little bit.

28
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:01,295
Possible mental illness involved.

29
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:03,427
Supervisor advised. You on scene?

30
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:05,473
Copy, car's rolling.

31
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:08,389
2124, got a wellness check.

32
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:10,347
3839 North Racine.

33
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:13,872
Caller states multiple members
of the Clarton family are gone.

34
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,875
Possible missing persons.

35
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,998
5021 Henry, hold me down
on that missing persons.

36
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:23,317
Copy, 5021 Henry.

37
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:34,806
Morning.

38
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,286
Detective Hailey Upton.

39
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,506
Morning. Your with Intelligence, yeah?

40
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:39,898
Dispatch detailed you?

41
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:42,466
- No, I just picked it up.
- Ah, okay.

42
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,946
There's probably not much for you here.

43
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,600
Next door neighbor, Jessica Hartley...

44
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:47,645
She's right over there... called it in.

45
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:49,299
Hasn't seen her neighbors in a few days.

46
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:50,518
The Clarton family.

47
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:52,389
Dad Ray, wife Helen,
and their kid, Becca.

48
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:53,390
She's 12.

49
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:55,697
- Signs of forced entry?
- Nah.

50
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,873
Sarge gave me the green light
to enter in a wellness check.

51
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,658
Front door was unlocked.
No signs of foul play.

52
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:02,165
Everything seems fine inside.

53
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:04,662
Jessica?

54
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:06,577
Hi, I'm Detective Hailey Upton.

55
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,318
When was the last time
you saw your neighbors?

56
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:10,842
A few days. Uh...

57
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,670
Goose, what day did we see them?

58
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:13,845
Before dance.

59
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,544
Right, so it would've been Tuesday.

60
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:18,807
- And this isn't like them?
- No.

61
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,287
I mean, I'm probably overreacting,

62
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,505
nosy next door neighbor.

63
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:24,552
It's just, they don't ever go anywhere,

64
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:26,945
and I had just talked to Helen.

65
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,252
I'm sorry.
I'm probably wasting your time.

66
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:32,255
It's just something felt off.

67
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,996
No. No time wasted.

68
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,495
We'll be right back.

69
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,479
You're the only one that's been inside?

70
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:39,654
Yeah.

71
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:50,621
Said they lived here for a while?

72
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:53,592
They're renting it.
Been here six months.

73
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,283
Smell that?

74
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:01,937
Place has been bleached recently.

75
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,435
Spring cleaning?

76
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:06,532
Garbage was taken out.
Bag wasn't replaced.

77
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:13,949
Man, I wish my daughter was this neat.

78
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:15,429
I can't even get her
to put her dirty clothes

79
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:17,387
in the laundry basket.

80
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:49,854
Can you get over here
and help me move this bed?

81
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:51,813
Towards you. Ready?

82
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:53,293
Yeah.

83
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,654
5021 Henry, I'm at the missing persons.

84
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:08,917
I need a crime lab rolled here ASAP.

85
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,658
Copy that, 5021 Henry.

86
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,616
Crime lab en route.

87
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:16,537
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

88
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:20,842
Hey.

89
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:23,682
Hey.

90
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,935
I had ones like those when I was a kid.

91
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:28,371
Swallows.

92
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,330
So you didn't make it to the shop, huh?

93
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:34,025
Uh, no. Um...

94
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:40,073
No, I didn't.

95
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:43,577
Team's just arriving.

96
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:51,612
Clarton home, husband Ray,
wife Helen, daughter Becca.

97
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:52,830
Talked to the rest of the block.

98
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,092
No one's seen them in at least two days.

99
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:55,398
And that's odd?

100
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:57,574
To our neighbor, Jessica, yeah.
They were homebodies.

101
00:05:57,618 --> 00:06:00,011
She said she just spoke with Helen
to get together the next day.

102
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:01,665
She called both their cells.
No one's answering.

103
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,014
Checked the phones,
and they're shut off.

104
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:04,189
And her car's in the garage.

105
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:05,843
There's cardboard boxes upstairs.

106
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:07,889
Empty suitcases.
They might've been packing.

107
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,551
Hey. Got something weird.

108
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,027
So I ran the name and social

109
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:17,812
the landlord gave me, Ray Clarton.

110
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,467
Problem is, Ray Clarton died
four years ago.

111
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,686
- He's using a false name?
- Yeah, on everything.

112
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,775
Utilities for the house,
credit card, car,

113
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,735
- all registered to a dead man.
- Okay, what about the wife?

114
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:29,127
She's not on paper anywhere,

115
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:30,781
and I got no hits on a Helen Clarton

116
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:32,653
in Chicago matching her descriptors.

117
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:34,219
The little girl, Becca, she's 12.

118
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:36,439
- She must be in school.
- She's not.

119
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:39,007
Not registered with CPS.
Not in a private school.

120
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,139
Ran missing persons too,
and I got nothing.

121
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:43,490
So dig into the name, Ray Clarton,

122
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,927
and see who had access
to steal his identity.

123
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:49,017
Let's do a full forensics search.

124
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,759
Let's find out who the hell
this family really is.

125
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:55,937
What the hell happened in this house?

126
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,721
Something happened to them,

127
00:06:57,765 --> 00:07:00,158
and you think
they were using fake names?

128
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:01,943
We know they were.

129
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:04,728
That doesn't make any sense.
They're a perfectly normal family.

130
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:07,078
Things often look normal,

131
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:09,559
but can't really know a family
unless they let you.

132
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:11,692
Do you know where Ray and Helen work?

133
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:14,564
Uh, Helen stays home.
I don't know about Ray.

134
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:16,000
All right, what about
where they're from?

135
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:17,088
Hometown?

136
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:20,657
I don't, um... I don't know.

137
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:25,887
Annie, were you friends with Becca?

138
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,103
No. She doesn't go to my school.

139
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:36,682
Becca seemed shy.

140
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,819
She keeps to herself.

141
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:42,112
Okay.

142
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:45,116
Anything you can tell us
about them at all,

143
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,118
really anything would help.

144
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:49,120
I don't know. I just...

145
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:52,297
Sometimes I do wonder about
how old-fashioned they are.

146
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:54,015
What do you mean?

147
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,128
Uh, it's just, Ray runs the house,

148
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:58,521
really runs it.

149
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:01,306
It doesn't seem like the girls
are independent.

150
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,612
Does he hurt them?

151
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:04,135
What? No.

152
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:07,008
Oh, God no.
I'm sure he doesn't hurt them.

153
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:09,184
I'm sure it's not that.

154
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,276
There's something wrong
with this family.

155
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,147
This little girl, Becca...

156
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:20,978
- All right, what do we got?
- Forensics came back.

157
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:22,980
Blood in the master is two days old

158
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:24,242
and belongs to a female.

159
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:26,157
DNA doesn't match anything on file,

160
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:29,596
but the tech said as long as
the blood came from an adult,

161
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,988
the amount of blood is not enough

162
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:32,294
to positively indicate a death.

163
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:34,296
Fingerprints off all the men's shoes

164
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:37,212
in the Clarton house
ID'd Ray's real name.

165
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:40,998
Meet Ray Aimes.
We've got a hell of a sheet.

166
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:44,262
Lived in 14 different states
the past 20 years,

167
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:46,308
multiple fraud investigations,

168
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:47,875
two domestics when he was younger.

169
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:50,617
Looks like he mostly deals
in Ponzi and pyramid schemes.

170
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,183
He's a grifter.

171
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:54,142
He's an old school conman.
He gets in close with people,

172
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:56,231
manipulates the hell out
of them, robs them blind,

173
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:57,841
and then he skips town.

174
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,669
What about the girls, Helen and Becca?

175
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:01,149
Their prints weren't in the system.

176
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,803
Ray's not legally married,

177
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:05,109
but the DNA found off
of the toothbrush in the home

178
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:07,851
confirms that Becca
is Ray and Helen's child.

179
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:09,592
And she's never been enrolled in school?

180
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,115
I checked everywhere that Ray lived.

181
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,203
She never been enrolled in school.

182
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:14,309
She never even been to a doctor.
Nothing.

183
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:15,859
I'm guessing there's abuse
in this family.

184
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:17,948
Physical, emotional.

185
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:20,385
- So you're thinking domestic?
- Makes sense.

186
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:22,953
We have a history of domestic assault.

187
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:25,695
He beats Helen too bad one day,
throws them both in the car,

188
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,262
takes off before he was planning to.

189
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:29,046
Ladies and gentlemen, we got a pop.

190
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,832
Ray Clarton's debit card
was used at an ATM

191
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,051
downtown yesterday
right after they went missing.

192
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:35,469
Roll on it.

193
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,882
All right, so your boy
and his daughter got there

194
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:41,145
at 9:15 a.m. Already called up the bank.

195
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:43,626
Ray withdrew the entirety
of his checking account.

196
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,106
$1,500.

197
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:47,891
Wait, we got a PO.
Is this kid gonna ask for help?

198
00:09:48,405 --> 00:09:50,894
No, she's not.

199
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:59,342
She looks scared.

200
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,599
- Do you have more cameras?
- Mm-hmm.

201
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,316
Oh, who the hell is that?

202
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:25,692
It's not a domestic. Somebody took them.

203
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,754
All right, who is this man?

204
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:39,290
Someone from Ray's past
come back to haunt him?

205
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:41,249
Maybe Ray conned the wrong guy,

206
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,729
end up over his head?

207
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:45,209
I've got no large deposits
on Ray's financials.

208
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,255
Nothing pops on the video.
Clothes are generic.

209
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,213
- Can't even make out Ray's.
- It really doesn't help

210
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,824
we know next to nothing
about this family.

211
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,739
Yeah, I reinterviewed
the neighbors on the block.

212
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:54,392
Nobody knew where they worked,

213
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:56,656
where they were from,
their family, nothing.

214
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,135
We have zero details on them.

215
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,789
Ray and Helen are good.

216
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,145
Yeah, but you learn how to be that way.

217
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:05,142
To shut people out, be invisible,

218
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:06,317
you learn it.

219
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,582
Becca's only 12 years old.

220
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:12,802
Maybe she hasn't learned
how to do that just yet.

221
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:21,811
We've been through
every inch of this place.

222
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:23,639
I don't know what else we're gonna find.

223
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,336
Anything. Anything that'll tell us

224
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,339
who they really are,
who might've taken them.

225
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:34,432
Jay, listen, um, about this morning.

226
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:35,651
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:39,350
I just got overwhelmed.

228
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,919
I kinda figured that when you
ran out of your apartment

229
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:44,399
and caught a case.

230
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:46,967
Uh, I just panicked.

231
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:49,360
It's not that I don't care
about you, or that I...

232
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:51,623
Hailey, there's a little girl
that's missing right now,

233
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,696
so we can do this later.

234
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:55,740
Really.

235
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:57,673
Kay.

236
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,360
Hey.

237
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,798
My partner's downstairs
with your mom and dad.

238
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:37,800
They said it was okay if you
and I chat a little bit.

239
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:40,542
- That all right with you?
- Uh-huh.

240
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:41,911
All right.

241
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:43,893
I like your room.

242
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:48,793
Hey, Becca's got the same ones.

243
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:52,728
You guys are good friends, huh?

244
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:55,566
Not really.

245
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:57,844
Hmm.

246
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:01,055
Becca's room does not look like this.

247
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:03,641
Her whole house really.

248
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:07,743
I've been a cop for 12 years,
and I think I can feel it now.

249
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,268
You know, when something feels wrong?

250
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:12,922
Becca's house is like that, right?

251
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,794
I don't know. I've never been there.

252
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:17,405
Hmm.

253
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:19,059
Is it okay if I sit?

254
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:20,712
Sure.

255
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,285
I had a house like that
when I was a kid.

256
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,899
Something was wrong.

257
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:34,923
I didn't tell anybody,

258
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,300
but I did have a best friend.

259
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:39,775
She lived down the street from me,

260
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:44,475
and even though I never told her
a word of it, she knew.

261
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,523
She knew something wrong,

262
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:50,960
and she would keep
her window unlocked for me,

263
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:53,528
so I could come inside
if I needed a place to hide.

264
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:58,363
Is that what the flashlights are for?

265
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:01,318
So you can go downstairs
and let Becca in?

266
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:10,632
Annie, you're a good friend.

267
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,001
You love her.

268
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:16,029
Sometimes when you love somebody
you have to tell the truth,

269
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:18,509
even if it feels like
you're betraying something.

270
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:23,097
Do you know what happened
to the Clartons?

271
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:32,872
Okay.

272
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:38,790
I don't understand what's going on.

273
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,096
You've hardly told us anything.

274
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,446
- Should we be calling a lawyer?
- No, no, no.

275
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,536
We're only here so it's on
film, and it's recorded.

276
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:46,874
Okay?

277
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:49,671
Now tell me the whole thing again.

278
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:51,455
You and Becca are friends.

279
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:53,457
Best friends.

280
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:56,939
- But we have to hide it.
- What?

281
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,549
Why, Annie?

282
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,859
Because the Clartons are scary.

283
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,861
Becca's scared of her parents.

284
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,732
Her dad doesn't let her go to school.

285
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,647
Doesn't let her have friends.

286
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:13,730
He hurts them.

287
00:15:15,356 --> 00:15:16,872
They used flashlights.

288
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,136
Anytime that Becca wanted to see Annie,

289
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,791
she'd shine a flashlight
through Annie's window.

290
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:24,706
Annie would wake up,
she'd go downstairs,

291
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:26,186
unlock the door,
and Becca would come over.

292
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:27,607
You're kidding me.

293
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:30,059
Two nights ago, the night
that the Clartons disappeared,

294
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:31,800
Becca shined a light
through Annie's window.

295
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:33,374
I saw a man.

296
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:36,065
He was walking through their house.

297
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:37,806
Did she get a good look at him?

298
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:39,199
No, he disappeared through the house.

299
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:40,983
So I went to the back door.

300
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:43,594
The man was leading Becca
and her parents outside.

301
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,902
- Mrs. Clarton looked hurt.
- Jesus.

302
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,643
Oh, Annie, why wouldn't
you say something?

303
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:50,688
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay, Annie.

304
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:52,212
We're learning it now. Just keep going.

305
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:53,735
He put them in a car.

306
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:56,651
Good, that's good. What kind of car?

307
00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:57,913
A station wagon.

308
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,871
One of those old ones.

309
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,962
He drove away with them.

310
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,055
We don't have a station wagon
on PODs outside that ATM.

311
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:10,534
Yeah, but we do have a witness

312
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:13,189
that puts a station wagon
outside the Clarton's house.

313
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:14,974
I mean, it left and went somewhere.

314
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:17,193
So get everything going
in a five mile radius.

315
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:20,022
It's a Mercury. It's a Mercury.

316
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,546
We showed Annie a dozen models,
and she pointed right to it.

317
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:25,027
I got one.

318
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:26,681
Real close to the Clartons' house,

319
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:29,727
11:23 p.m.,
heading northbound on Western.

320
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:32,948
Yep, I got him again.
11:29, Western and Franklin.

321
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,471
Headed on 66.

322
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:36,691
And those plates are hot.
They're stolen.

323
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:37,779
That's him.

324
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:39,999
Get those plates out on an all-call.

325
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,088
Five minutes later,
he's still going west on 66.

326
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:44,090
Just keep following.
See where he leads us.

327
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,800
We get the station wagon
pulling in here,

328
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:00,294
and then we lose him.

329
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,718
Well, he probably ditched
the car and swapped it.

330
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,502
All right, let's fan out.

331
00:17:26,394 --> 00:17:29,397
- Jay.
- What do you got?

332
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:35,880
They're the same sheets.

333
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:38,709
They're the same sheets from the house.

334
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,842
Okay.

335
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:44,063
Hold on.

336
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:51,940
Oh, my God.

337
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:11,538
Her mouth.

338
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:14,305
Looks like she doesn't have any teeth.

339
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:19,228
- Or fingerprints.
- Yeah.

340
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:21,230
Whoever killed her knew
what they were doing.

341
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:23,667
No way we're gonna get an ID off of her.

342
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:25,669
The tech search and the banks
haven't found anything.

343
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:27,280
We've got zero evidence.

344
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:29,325
This looks like an organized crime kill.

345
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:33,329
Yeah, well, whoever did it,

346
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:35,198
they killed her here,

347
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:38,378
and burned her hands,
pulled her teeth out.

348
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:40,094
Hopefully in that order.

349
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,382
The offender drove directly
from the Clartons' home

350
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:43,818
to this location.

351
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:46,125
He had Becca and Ray in the car
when he killed Helen.

352
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:49,694
He did that to her body
in front of her little kid.

353
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,739
Why?

354
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:55,177
$1,500 out of Ray's bank account?

355
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:56,700
Hey, we got lucky.

356
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:58,833
Security camera caught a man
in frame for a moment.

357
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:01,314
There's no wagon or family,
but I think it's the offender.

358
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:02,792
Might be enough for facial rec.

359
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:06,232
Yo, Sarge, we got ID.

360
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:08,408
- Huh.
- Name's Alejandro Hermanez.

361
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:10,227
His height and weight
matched the ATM video.

362
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:12,673
- Priors?
- Nothing official.

363
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:14,370
The FBI, they've been investigating him.

364
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:16,198
They like him as a for-hire enforcer.

365
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,157
- Uh-huh.
- He works in extortion

366
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,680
and cleanup for organized crime outlets,

367
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:21,377
most recently the Albanian syndicate.

368
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:24,163
So Ray upgraded.
Decided to con the big men.

369
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,468
That takes stones.

370
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:28,428
Well, con is short for confidence.

371
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:30,169
This time it's short for stupid.

372
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,432
It was definitely stupid.

373
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:34,347
Last time Hermanez got investigated,

374
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,392
it was for a stash house theft.

375
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:37,698
Uh-huh.

376
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:39,569
Somebody skimmed money
and dope off the top,

377
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:41,267
and Alejandro put him in the ground.

378
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,791
And we found two pro-grade
traps behind a false wall

379
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:45,227
in a cabinet downstairs.

380
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,576
Let me guess. Both empty.

381
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,143
Yeah, no signs of drug residue,

382
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,666
- so it must've been cash.
- Fits.

383
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,755
These guys love to bury
cash houses in plain sight.

384
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,409
You get a normal looking family
with kids,

385
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:55,716
safe neighborhood,
safe block, safe money.

386
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,326
So we're thinking Ray was dumb enough

387
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,459
to steal from the Albanians,
skim off the top?

388
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:00,935
Old habits die hard.

389
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:03,245
Ray stolen from every person
he's ever met.

390
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,726
Guy manipulates,
controls even his own family.

391
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:07,960
He probably thought he could skip town
before they caught on.

392
00:20:08,003 --> 00:20:09,947
I mean, it explains why
Hermanez had to abduct him.

393
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:11,340
He went to the house, kills Helen

394
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:12,646
to convince Ray to give up that money.

395
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:13,821
- Mm.
- Right.

396
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:15,431
But there's no way it was only $1,500.

397
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:17,607
I mean, those traps
can hide millions in cash.

398
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:18,695
Hmm.

399
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:20,001
So if there's still cash out there,

400
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:22,612
Becca and Ray are still alive.
Hermanez is a pro.

401
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:25,267
He won't kill them till
he gets all the cash back.

402
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:26,355
It's possible.

403
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:28,401
No, not just possible. It's who Ray is.

404
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:29,924
He would take everything he could.

405
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:32,579
All right, so where the hell
is Hermanez now?

406
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:34,885
I don't know have any LKAs,
and the FBI's got zero.

407
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:37,453
I might have something.
Hermanez has a car.

408
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:38,976
It's registered to a bogus address,

409
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,457
but he got two tickets
in the last two months,

410
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:43,938
three blocks from the bathhouse
that Vice ID'd.

411
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:44,982
It's a brothel.

412
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:46,680
Okay, so our guy's got a vice.

413
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:48,508
Maybe somebody there knows
where he hangs his hat.

414
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:50,379
All right, so you two move on it.

415
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:51,815
Get an ASA on board.

416
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:54,253
If we find this guy,
I wanna know we're solid.

417
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:02,391
Get you all set...

418
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:07,542
It's this one.

419
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,270
Chicago PD.

420
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,488
Jesus. What the...

421
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:13,750
You get up, get out.
I'm not touching you

422
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:15,424
without your clothes on. Let's go.

423
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:17,928
You're not going anywhere. Back up.

424
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:19,495
Here.

425
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:22,455
- The hell is going on?
- You Zara?

426
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:23,760
We're looking for Alejandro Hermanez.

427
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:24,979
We're told he's one of your regulars.

428
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:26,241
I don't know what you're talking about.

429
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,330
No, we're not gonna do that.

430
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:29,505
He kidnapped a 12-year-old girl.

431
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,816
- He's gonna kill her.
- What?

432
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:34,336
I'm assuming that you know
what he really is.

433
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,425
So let's not pretend
that you weren't once 12,

434
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:37,687
and that you don't care
about a little kid.

435
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:38,906
Do you know where he lives?

436
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:41,343
You ever pay him a private visit,
leave the bosses out of their cut?

437
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:46,870
Where does he live, Zara?

438
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:48,350
Or I will happily arrest you

439
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:49,569
and let the owners of this place know

440
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:50,918
you're the reason
we're shutting it down.

441
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:52,659
What do you think
they're gonna do to you then?

442
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:55,969
Where?

443
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,359
Hegewisch.

444
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:59,361
He lives outside Hegewisch.

445
00:22:16,716 --> 00:22:18,370
All right, this is the address.

446
00:22:18,395 --> 00:22:19,745
Yeah.

447
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:23,073
Yeah, there's a trailer.

448
00:22:23,117 --> 00:22:24,821
Sarge, we're at Alejandro's place.

449
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:27,913
Jay, there's a shed. They're in there.

450
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,349
Sarge, there's a shed on the property.

451
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,741
It's got a padlock on it.

452
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,787
Copy that. Hold eyes on it.

453
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,049
There he is.

454
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:37,047
Sarge, we got eyes on Hermanez.

455
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,447
He's got a gun on him.

456
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,014
We have every reason to believe
she's in there right now.

457
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:45,755
I hear you, but wait for backup.

458
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,888
We're on with the ASA. Hold an anchor.

459
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:49,977
He's walking towards the shed.
We need to move.

460
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,270
Hailey.

461
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:55,548
Hailey!

462
00:22:57,463 --> 00:22:59,813
Hands behind your back!

463
00:22:59,856 --> 00:23:01,858
Chicago PD. Do not fight me.

464
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:03,127
- Hailey, you good?
- I'm good.

465
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,618
- You good?
- I'm good! Get on your knees.

466
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:09,953
- What the hell's going on?
- The shed's clear.

467
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:11,651
- You got him?
- Yeah, here.

468
00:23:11,694 --> 00:23:13,914
Don't move. Hailey, Hailey!

469
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:16,438
Hey, what's she doing?
You can't just go into my home!

470
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:19,006
Shut up, shut up. Come here.

471
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:25,752
Becca?

472
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:32,846
Becca?

473
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,555
So are we no longer listening
to direct orders?

474
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:09,317
Becca could've been in that shed.

475
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,642
You didn't have
an arrest warrant in hand.

476
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,975
You didn't even have a search warrant.

477
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:17,151
Sarge, Hermanez had a gun
in plain sight,

478
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:18,638
so if they had been in there...

479
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:23,984
All right, get the little girl,
Annie, back in here.

480
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:26,856
Get her to confirm Hermanez
in a six-pack.

481
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:36,431
And if we hadn't seen the gun?

482
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:43,307
I would've moved anyway.
She could've been in that shed.

483
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:48,225
We'll get it backstopped by an ASA.

484
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:50,489
It's exigent circumstances. She's a kid.

485
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:07,070
I just need you to look at these photos

486
00:25:07,114 --> 00:25:09,159
and tell me if you recognize
the man that you saw

487
00:25:09,203 --> 00:25:11,994
the night Becca disappeared, okay?

488
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:20,606
Is Becca gonna be okay?

489
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:24,548
I don't know for sure,

490
00:25:25,262 --> 00:25:28,439
but we're doing absolutely everything
in our power to find her.

491
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:32,618
I'm sorry. I don't know who it was.

492
00:25:33,815 --> 00:25:35,251
Okay.

493
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:43,411
Tell you what, we're gonna
do it one more time,

494
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:45,587
and this time,

495
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:48,547
I want you to look really slowly, okay?

496
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:01,772
Him.

497
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:04,563
It was him. I saw him.

498
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:06,412
Great.

499
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:18,751
I mean, do you understand? Hmm?

500
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:21,710
Let me run it down for you.
We have an eye witness

501
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:23,625
that confirms you were in
the Clartons' house.

502
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:26,236
We have you on toll cams
in the station wagon.

503
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,629
We have you at the underpass.

504
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:31,154
We have your DNA on Helen.

505
00:26:31,198 --> 00:26:33,983
We got you locked in.
You gonna die in the cage.

506
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:36,120
So there's no point
in not talking to us.

507
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:39,685
Where are Becca and Ray?

508
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:41,774
It doesn't really matter
what you say to me,

509
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:44,298
'cause I can whisper to them
that you sang

510
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:46,517
and make sure you end up in a cell block

511
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:49,129
where they can reach you,
do what they want.

512
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:52,175
We don't care about Ray.

513
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,307
In case you hadn't figured it out,

514
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,004
his name's not even Ray Clarton.

515
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:57,790
He's a low-ranked conman
who beats his wife and kid.

516
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,661
What we care about is the kid.

517
00:26:59,977 --> 00:27:01,663
You tell us where we can find her,

518
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:04,274
we're gonna put you down
as a cooperating defendant.

519
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:06,363
Good cell block, prison you choose,

520
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:08,017
minimum sentence.

521
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,412
Kid doesn't deserve to be
punished for her dad's sins.

522
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:15,285
So you get a deal.

523
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,121
I don't know who these people are.

524
00:27:19,825 --> 00:27:22,262
I don't know why you entered my home.

525
00:27:26,503 --> 00:27:28,172
I'm very sorry.

526
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:33,695
They're alive. We can break him.

527
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:35,523
Yeah, he's messing with us.

528
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:37,177
'Cause he knows we don't have enough.

529
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,700
All right, what else do we have?

530
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:41,137
Phone's clean. Nothing on cams.

531
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:44,184
His car's GPS shows movement
earlier this morning.

532
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:45,446
Uh-huh.

533
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:48,275
Hermanez drove to a PO box
in Humboldt Park.

534
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:51,626
I confirmed with the staff
that Ray owns a PO box there.

535
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,629
Hermanez accessed the box.
He left with that bag.

536
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,371
Two blocks later, it looks like
he made a physical exchange.

537
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:58,851
So they got their money back.

538
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,635
Ray told Hermanez
where he was hiding it.

539
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,768
All right, do we have
any other leverage?

540
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,204
His financials are pretty clean,

541
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:06,206
but he does make one deposit each month

542
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:08,338
- to a long-term care facility.
- Uh-huh.

543
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:10,645
- Other than that, I don't have any...
- We can use that.

544
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,734
Hermanez is probably paying for family.

545
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:15,781
We know he doesn't have any
documented family in the U.S.,

546
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:17,608
so they must be illegal.

547
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:19,741
So we confirm their noncitizenship,

548
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:22,184
and we threaten him with ICE.

549
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:25,747
All right, there's no
guarantee he'll talk for that,

550
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,749
and we can't threaten him unless we know

551
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:29,838
who it is he's paying for,
ID their citizenship.

552
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:31,231
So we ID them.

553
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:33,189
Well, the problem is, that's illegal.

554
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:34,408
We can't contact ICE.

555
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:35,496
Can't even ask about citizenship.

556
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:37,280
You can as a private citizen.

557
00:28:37,324 --> 00:28:39,500
It's still illegal.
I think you know that.

558
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:41,328
Okay, but it's also all we got.

559
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:42,546
This is a little girl.

560
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,331
She hasn't been protected
a day in her life.

561
00:28:44,374 --> 00:28:46,768
Doesn't know that she can be,
that she should be.

562
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:48,770
And if there's a chance that
she could still be alive,

563
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:50,641
then we protect her.

564
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:52,556
We will.

565
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,775
Just not that way.

566
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:56,517
Sarge, it could work,
and we've crossed worse lines before.

567
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,435
Did you not hear me say no?

568
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:12,185
All right, look.

569
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,571
This is simple.

570
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:18,713
Ray and Becca are somewhere.
Wherever that is,

571
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,760
there's gonna be
a clear link to Hermanez.

572
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:24,240
So find it now.

573
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:42,014
Hey, Hailey.

574
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:44,011
What's going on?

575
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:47,263
Come on, you're not going there
anyway, so just stop.

576
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:48,787
No one's gonna even know I went.

577
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,485
Yeah, what are you gonna do
with the information?

578
00:29:51,528 --> 00:29:54,140
How's no one gonna know
when you use it in the interview room?

579
00:29:54,183 --> 00:29:55,663
I'll figure that part out
if there's anything usable.

580
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:57,012
What is going on?

581
00:29:57,056 --> 00:29:59,449
- There's a little kid missing.
- I know that.

582
00:29:59,493 --> 00:30:02,670
What's going on with you?
What... all this.

583
00:30:02,713 --> 00:30:04,846
- You're spinning out.
- Spinning out?

584
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,717
Yeah, you're gonna tell me you're not?

585
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,676
You're gonna tell me it's fine?
That you're all good,

586
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:11,627
then shut me out, go
jeopardize your job some more?

587
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:14,508
I don't know if it's Ray or Becca,

588
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:15,988
or if this all reminds you of your past,

589
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:17,685
but something's wrong.
I just want you to talk to me

590
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:20,383
and tell me how you're feeling
so I can help you.

591
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:21,950
So you can help?

592
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:23,822
What do you wanna know, Jay?

593
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:27,608
Why I'm crossing lines?
Why I'm fine with it?

594
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:30,872
Why I shut you out?
Why I shut down this morning?

595
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,395
No, that's not it at all.

596
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:35,964
But this is what you do.

597
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:37,357
Okay.

598
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,707
So then why don't you ask
the real question?

599
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,883
"What's wrong with me,
exactly how screwed up am I,

600
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:43,885
and at what point do you
cut your losses and run?"

601
00:30:46,954 --> 00:30:49,456
Because that's what you wanna know, Jay.

602
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:55,418
I can't answer that.

603
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:37,156
- Where are we?
- Nowhere.

604
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:40,811
We ran every cell, tower, POD. Nothing.

605
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:44,032
Hermanez never left his property
except to go to the PO box.

606
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:46,026
I don't know where he took them.

607
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:51,126
Maybe they've been dead the whole
time we've been looking for them.

608
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:55,217
Best and worst lottery in the world:

609
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:57,916
Parents you get, kind of love you get.

610
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,135
Yeah.

611
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:01,528
You have to carry
the score around with you

612
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:03,399
for the rest of your life.

613
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:08,448
There's just something about this girl.

614
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,539
She took his hand.

615
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,282
She's just so...

616
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:19,671
Trapped in it.

617
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:34,953
He was walking to his shed.

618
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:40,219
Hermanez had his gun on him,
and he was walking to his shed.

619
00:32:40,262 --> 00:32:41,394
Okay.

620
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:43,396
Can we get blueprints of the property?

621
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:49,315
- He buried them.
- What?

622
00:32:49,358 --> 00:32:51,230
We never saw Hermanez leave his property

623
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:53,841
after the PO box
because he didn't have to.

624
00:32:53,884 --> 00:32:56,931
Hermanez lives at the edge of
industrial land in Hegewisch.

625
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,107
His trailer is right where
a factory was.

626
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:00,717
Now the factory's gone,

627
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:03,459
but that whole area is filled
with underground storage tanks.

628
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:06,506
Hermanez has three of them
on his property.

629
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:10,118
Hermanez left, went to
the PO box, picked up the cash,

630
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:13,121
dropped it off, came back.
Jay and I were pulling up

631
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:15,645
as he was walking to his shed
with his gun.

632
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:17,908
He was on his way to kill them.

633
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:19,519
We just got there first.

634
00:33:19,562 --> 00:33:21,173
They're still there.

635
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:25,307
Victims are a tender aged female

636
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:26,961
and an adult male.

637
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,095
We have credible intelligence
they're buried in this ground.

638
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,662
So we're conduct a grid,

639
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:34,403
we separate three feet apart

640
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:36,884
and search every inch of this property.

641
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,321
Address off of me.

642
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,285
Let's go.

643
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:06,348
Hold on.

644
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:08,089
I got something.

645
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:15,444
- I got an edge.
- You got an edge?

646
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:17,055
Yeah, here. Come on.

647
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,384
She's alive!

648
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:45,387
Get those paramedics over here now!

649
00:34:45,431 --> 00:34:47,607
Father's DOA!

650
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,229
I gotcha, I gotcha.

651
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:04,102
Hi, sweetie. It's okay.

652
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,365
It's okay. I got you.

653
00:35:06,408 --> 00:35:09,629
It's okay.

654
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:14,416
Hey, I'm Hailey.

655
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,390
It's okay, no one else
is gonna hurt you, okay?

656
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,206
I got you. I got you.

657
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:23,121
Okay?

658
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:33,261
- You're still here, huh?
- Yeah.

659
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:35,742
I'm guessing
for the same reason you are.

660
00:35:35,785 --> 00:35:38,397
I'm waiting for Med to call,
give Becca the all clear.

661
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:40,181
Hmm.

662
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:42,415
She ID'd Hermanez.

663
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,448
She's lucid, calm.

664
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:48,146
Strong kid.

665
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,801
I was gonna get some coffee.
You want some?

666
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:53,238
Yeah.

667
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:58,721
You know, if I wasn't working with you

668
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:00,723
- and Jay...
- Mm.

669
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:03,073
I would've used ICE.

670
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:05,647
I know. Wouldn't have worked.

671
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,167
Hermanez never would've talked.

672
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,690
Yeah.

673
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:13,693
I would've crossed a line
only to have run out of time.

674
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:15,216
Wouldn't have figured out
where they were.

675
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,480
Would've just done it blindly
to break him.

676
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:21,570
- What does that say about me?
- Hmm.

677
00:36:22,837 --> 00:36:25,971
- You want an honest answer?
- Wait, you got one?

678
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:36,803
He says you became a cop

679
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:38,239
because when you were a little kid,

680
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:40,459
your dad beat your mom, beat you.

681
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,644
You couldn't do anything about it 'cause

682
00:36:45,638 --> 00:36:48,523
you were just a child.
He was bigger than you.

683
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:52,694
You don't know my family.

684
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:54,690
I know you.

685
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:58,694
My dad's not some villain
from a gothic novel.

686
00:36:58,738 --> 00:37:00,522
I get that.

687
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:03,913
Hailey, you got a gun and a badge.

688
00:37:05,783 --> 00:37:07,349
You're bigger now.

689
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:11,744
So every monster I see is my dad?

690
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,669
Are they?

691
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:18,970
Every hurt little kid is me?

692
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:21,681
What, am I unfit to be a cop?

693
00:37:23,937 --> 00:37:26,269
If you're unfit, I'm unfit.

694
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,250
You're not the first person
to psychoanalyze me,

695
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:33,512
not even today.

696
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,402
I'm sure that's true.

697
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:44,816
Hey, you're good at this job...

698
00:37:46,644 --> 00:37:48,733
For the same reasons you're bad at it.

699
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:54,315
You control yourself

700
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:55,838
miraculously well.

701
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,538
You were calm,

702
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:02,931
balanced, unemotional...

703
00:38:05,957 --> 00:38:08,568
Till something touches
that bruised part of you...

704
00:38:12,787 --> 00:38:14,572
And you lose all control.

705
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:19,346
I don't wanna be that way.

706
00:38:21,806 --> 00:38:23,590
- I don't.
- I know.

707
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:27,305
And you can find a way not to be.

708
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:31,831
'Cause I think this way...

709
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:37,414
I really think this way's
gonna cost you.

710
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,781
You came.

711
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:03,732
You asked me to.

712
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:11,261
I don't think I ever really learned

713
00:39:11,305 --> 00:39:12,917
how to do it properly.

714
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,213
Relationships, intimacy.

715
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:20,413
Telling people how I feel.

716
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:23,970
You couldn't do that in my house.

717
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:27,582
When I was a kid,
being told "I love you"

718
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:31,281
was always after "I'm sorry."
They were the same thing.

719
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:33,210
"I'm sorry I hurt you.
It won't happen again.

720
00:39:33,262 --> 00:39:34,568
I love you."

721
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,766
And you know,

722
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,652
I believe it every time.

723
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,030
And they did love me,

724
00:39:42,861 --> 00:39:45,646
but then a day later, a week later...

725
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:53,521
Maybe there's some part of me

726
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:54,870
that every time I hear "I love you,"

727
00:39:54,914 --> 00:39:56,916
I'm just waiting for the punch.

728
00:39:58,037 --> 00:40:00,518
For the "I'm sorry" that's gonna come.

729
00:40:03,923 --> 00:40:06,404
Look, I don't know how to do this,

730
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,057
but I want to.

731
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:13,367
I want to so badly.

732
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:16,544
I wanna be with you,

733
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:19,286
I wanna learn to do this,

734
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:21,653
I want to be better.

735
00:40:32,174 --> 00:40:34,133
Then we'll figure it out.

736
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:40,861
'Cause I wanna be with you too.

737
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,677
And I'm not going anywhere, Hailey.

738
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:50,970
Really, I'm not.

739
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:58,325
Jay, I do.

740
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:02,460
I love you so much.

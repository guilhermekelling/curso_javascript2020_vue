1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,006
- Moving here was the best
decision we ever made.

2
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:06,838
We can just drink
on the street.

3
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:10,114
- Here’s to going
hard all night long.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,975
- Cheers.

5
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,223
[snoring]

6
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,851
- Okay, babe,
let’s get you home.

7
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:20,316
- Okay.

8
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,364
- What?

9
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:23,859
Did you forget to pay rent?

10
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,331
- Is it the first already?
- It’s the 15th.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,330
[gasps]

12
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,331
[doors rattle]

13
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,102
- They changed the locks.

14
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,070
- Or they just locked the door.
You’re not using your key.

15
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,899
- You know what?
It’s cool.

16
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,444
Me and the landlord
are pretty tight.

17
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,399
Yeah, we’re chill.
We text like every day.

18
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:42,113
- This is just an ongoing thread
of her begging you to pay rent

19
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,742
and you responding with gifs.

20
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,107
She said this morning,
"This is your last warning.

21
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,346
Pay rent or you’re evicted,
you absolute shitshow."

22
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,193
You respond, "whoops, lol"

23
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,359
with a gif of Kelsey Grammer
falling off a stage.

24
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,689
God damn it, Emily!

25
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,293
- I thought we were
goofing around.

26
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,195
- Why?

27
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,727
- Well, looks like we’re going
apartment hunting tomorrow.

28
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:06,403
Better get a good
night’s sleep, right?

29
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,733
- On the sidewalk?

30
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,136
[snoring]

31
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,710
- Wow, you are a shitshow.

32
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,893
- This place is such a catch.

33
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,719
Amazing location,
close to the subway.

34
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,885
[rattling]

35
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,193
Upstairs from it, actually.

36
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,396
Very lively neighborhood.

37
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,629
[muffled shouting]

38
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,963
[gunshot]

39
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,302
[alarm blaring]

40
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,174
Mm-hmm.

41
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,172
[chuckles]

42
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,343
[rattling]

43
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,572
This one has a
totally retro kitchen.

44
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,513
And plumbing.

45
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,155
Whoa, neat.

46
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,450
[rattling]

47
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,751
- The neighbors are so friendly.

48
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,023
They just had twins.

49
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,791
[babies crying]

50
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,420
No surprise, because
they are always doing it.

51
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,686
[moaning]

52
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,024
- Already, Darren?

53
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,788
- It does not make me
less of a man.

54
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,758
- Whatever. This is the
nicest place we’ve seen.

55
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,426
We’ll take it.
[bell dings]

56
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,605
- Ah, I’m so sorry.
It just went off the market.

57
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,144
- Just now?
- Mm-hmm.

58
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,768
- While we were talking?
- Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,644
- I could put
in a counter offer,

60
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,843
but the other couple has offered
six months’ rent in advance.

61
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,905
What’s your credit score?
- Uh...

62
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:29,952
- A+.

63
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,153
[laughs]

64
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,786
- Get out.

65
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,164
- A+, Murph?
What were you thinking?

66
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,364
A- is much more believable.

67
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,968
- Thanks for coming!

68
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,502
- Moving day, Bee.

69
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,067
- After two weeks of dating,

70
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,635
you’re finally
moving in with me.

71
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,645
My friends call it
a mid-life crisis,

72
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,707
but my company is
going to solve aging,

73
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,405
so there’s no such
thing as mid-life.

74
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:03,517
- Whatever. You got rid of that
weird roommate, right?

75
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,420
- Oh, that was,
uh, that was my wife.

76
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,322
- Whoever she was,
she had an attitude.

77
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,195
- Well, she did catch us
in our marital bed.

78
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,393
Uh, can I get your bags?

79
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,435
- Oh, um, actually, real quick,

80
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,890
I just have, like,
a few more things.

81
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:21,697
[grunts]

82
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,272
- I assume you didn’t read
that copy of

83
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,537
the "Life-Changing Power of
Tidying Up" that I gave you.

84
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,506
- Yeah, but I got, like,
halfway through the title,

85
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,415
and I got, like, bored.

86
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,447
Like, why would
I throw things out?

87
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,452
Then I wouldn’t have things.

88
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,294
- Nuh-huh, sorry babe.
I don’t do clutter.

89
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,749
That’s one of
my ten tenets of success.

90
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,188
My ten-nets, if you will.

91
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,023
Some of this stuff’s got to go.

92
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:50,358
- But Brycie, we have to make
your home feel like our home.

93
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:54,627
How would you feel if you
left your fiancé of two months

94
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,638
to move in with your millionaire
boyfriend of two weeks?

95
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:02,441
You’d probably need, like,
a lot of pairs of shoes, right?

96
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:05,246
That’s like a really
brave thing to do.

97
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,878
- Shoes are fine, Bridget.
It’s this other stuff.

98
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,954
You got like a picnic
basket of hanging balls,

99
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,453
whatever those are.

100
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,925
- I mean, do we really need
an entire box

101
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,994
of Marilyn Monroe
coffee table books?

102
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,493
- Oh, yeah, I just like
super relate to her.

103
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,796
I like love all her quotes about
having an awful personality

104
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,599
and how people just like
have to deal with it.

105
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,901
- Yeah, I’m seeing
a lot of quotes in here.

106
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,473
Quotes on pillows.
Quotes on picture frames.

107
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,613
Big quotes built out
of many smaller quotes.

108
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,169
- Well, I’m sorry
if I’m deep, Bryce.

109
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,608
- Is that deep?
"This bitch needs wine"?

110
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,614
- Wine is deep.
They have it Europe.

111
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,177
- What is this shirt for?

112
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,285
- Oh, my God, Bryce.
For when this bitch needs wine.

113
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,088
Literally, it’s like
the only item of clothing

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,320
you don’t need explained.

115
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,195
- Do we need three boxes
full of candles?

116
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,964
- Oh, okay,
good question, Bryce.

117
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,493
Um, do we need the house to
smell like Tahitian vanilla?

118
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,098
Yes.

119
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,929
- Do you need a whole barrel
full of dream catchers?

120
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,195
- Oh, okay. So you would
just be like cool

121
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,304
if I just got like
killed by a spirit. Wow.

122
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,637
- There are no spirits in my
luxury smart home, Bridget.

123
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,384
It was built in 2017.

124
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,309
- Okay, yeah, and if you want
it to stay that way,

125
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,314
you’ll let me hang
that dream catcher,

126
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:17,676
light some incense, and do an
intention ritual with my coven.

127
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,387
What? It works.

128
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,989
I put a hex on my ex’s ex,
and she got pregnant.

129
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:25,662
Can you imagine?
Being fat?

130
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,804
- All right,
why don’t we start small.

131
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,529
We can throw out some of
these old Halloween costumes.

132
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,235
We’ve got sexy police officer.

133
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,467
- Not that one.

134
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,742
- Sexy firefighter.
- I...

135
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,471
- Sexy volunteer firefighter.

136
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,137
How is this different?

137
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,675
- Um, okay, I’ll just
like spell it out for you.

138
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,551
Like the fact
that they aren’t doing it

139
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,750
for money makes it sexier.

140
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,582
- But does it spark joy?

141
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:54,217
- Like my picture frame?
- No.

142
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,594
- I guess people really like--

143
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,192
- Put it in your hands, okay?

144
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,694
Really take a moment.

145
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,726
How does it make you feel?

146
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,140
- It makes me feel...

147
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,378
like if you threw it out,
I’d lose my shit.

148
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,011
I’m sorry.

149
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,376
Are you like trying
to get out of helping me move

150
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,245
because you’re like old?
- No.

151
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,424
- Because you’re acting
really old.

152
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,852
- 45 is the new 25.

153
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,047
I ran a half marathon
last month.

154
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,618
I eat acai bowls.

155
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,856
I take concentrated
yak musk supplements.

156
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,062
In 10 years, I’ll be ageless
and living on Mars.

157
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,534
- Whatever. It’s no big.
I’ll just like text my ex.

158
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,233
He’s a personal trainer.

159
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:43,405
He loves doing me favors
because he knows I’m like...

160
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:46,866
...super appreciative.

161
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,137
- That won’t be necessary.

162
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,444
Let me text
my personal assistant.

163
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,819
- So, it’s really
over then, huh?

164
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,092
- I guess so.

165
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,392
I can’t believe you’re leaving.

166
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,635
- Oh, uh, I thought
you were leaving.

167
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,162
- No, I thought
you were leaving.

168
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,826
- Are you kidding me?

169
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:12,905
I’m not walking away from
this sweet apartment.

170
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,273
- Neither would I.

171
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,331
This is the best place
I’ve ever lived.

172
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,798
There’s a fucking clawfoot tub.

173
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,179
- Hannah, I can’t
let you be trapped

174
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,838
in this home that we shared.

175
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:27,177
Let this 2,000 square foot
rent-controlled apartment

176
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,783
be my burden to bear.

177
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:33,515
- So selfless, but Brennan,
after everything I did,

178
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,923
you should be the one to go out.

179
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,316
Meet new people.

180
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,289
Like a realtor.

181
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,298
He’ll help you find a new place.

182
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,470
- Just go, Hannah!

183
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,128
It hurts for me to see you here.

184
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,297
And take our memories with you.

185
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,708
They’re cheesy as fuck
and they ruin the décor.

186
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,310
[glass breaks]

187
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,542
- Oh, that’s fine.
I’m fine with that.

188
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,677
I’m okay with things being
a little out of place.

189
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,683
You’re the neat freak.

190
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:06,616
How will you deal with
the nasty wine stain on the rug?

191
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,793
- What wine stain?

192
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,797
- That wine stain.

193
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,959
- I can replace it.

194
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,297
- Ah!

195
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,631
- I cheated on you.

196
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,997
There, in the bedroom
we once shared.

197
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,745
- You sick bitch.

198
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,040
I’ll have to burn the mattress,
because I’m not leaving.

199
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,672
- It was actually on the floor.

200
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,807
Our passion was too great,
and we made love on this

201
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,913
gorgeous reclaimed
wood flooring.

202
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,315
God, I love these floors.

203
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,347
- You’re killing me, Hannah!

204
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,323
Because I hate talking
on the phone,

205
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,521
and now I’m going to have
to call the landlord

206
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,152
to get the floors refinished.

207
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,717
- That’s who I cheated
on you with.

208
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,556
Do you really want to write
a check every month

209
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:48,031
to the man who cuckolded you?

210
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,661
- Yeah, that’s fine.
I’ll write him a check.

211
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,156
- Get the fuck out of my
super-fucking cool apartment!

212
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,698
- I’m not leaving this
apartment! It’s too sick.

213
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,203
- The lease is in my name.
- My mom co-signed.

214
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:58,745
- Okay, fine.

215
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,612
We’re both adults.

216
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,080
We’ll just cohabitate until
one of us finds another place.

217
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,350
Or I bring a guy home and
make you so jealous

218
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,679
with our super-loud
lovemaking that you just leave

219
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,184
on your own accord.

220
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,015
- You’re not loud.
- Maybe not with you.

221
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,763
- This place is so big.

222
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,763
- $800 a month.

223
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,565
This old bag has no idea
what she’s got.

224
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,467
We love the place.
- Oh, thank you.

225
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,070
You know, my daughter
and son-in-law

226
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,973
bought their first home, so I
was feeling a little lonesome.

227
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,237
I don’t need the money.
Really, I don’t.

228
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,706
I’m just looking to take
in a sweet young couple

229
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,055
that would like to save up
for their first home.

230
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,881
- Aw, that’s so nice.

231
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,317
I shouldn’t have called
the old bag an old bag.

232
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,252
- We should jump on this
before someone else scoops it.

233
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,258
- Yeah.

234
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,259
- Hi.
- Hi.

235
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,120
- Oh, hi.

236
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,628
- I’m Grant.
- I’m Jon.

237
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,130
- I hope you don’t mind
we brought flowers.

238
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,601
- Oh, isn’t that lovely?

239
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,799
- Oh, my goodness.
This place is beautiful.

240
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,073
The kitchen is gorgeous.
We love to cook.

241
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,802
- Ain’t that something?
So do I.

242
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,067
- We will have to trade recipes.

243
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,336
- Yes, we will.

244
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,643
Let me show you the rest
of the house.

245
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,515
And that’s Grant and--
- Jon.

246
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,213
- --Jon. Come on.
- This is great.

247
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,507
- Did he just stunt on me?

248
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,018
- Oh, my God, he stunted on you.

249
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,250
- I think this is
what stunting is.

250
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:39,515
- Well, it’s getting to be
this old bag’s bedtime.

251
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,479
I’ll review the applications
in the morning, my darlings.

252
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,379
- What did you put for
our current landlord?

253
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,580
- I put my brother’s number.
- Nice.

254
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:49,253
- Remind me to text
him a head’s up later.

255
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,022
- Angela, would you mind
if we took one more look

256
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,590
at your veranda?

257
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,249
- Yeah, we wanted to measure it
for our herb garden.

258
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,257
- Oh, an herb garden.
I used to have an herb garden.

259
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,989
Of course, come on.
Come on.

260
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,864
[chattering]

261
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,293
- We also had an herb garden.

262
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,834
- God damn it, they’re perfect.

263
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,095
Why did I waste my good cursive
on this application?

264
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,204
- Oh, it isn’t over yet.

265
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,706
I secretly photographed
their application.

266
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:17,039
Look, we have all their info.
Let’s go dig up some dirt.

267
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:24,278
- Oh, Brennan, you’re here.

268
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:27,087
Shoot, I just got back
with my romantic partner.

269
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,850
- Huh?

270
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,118
- I understand this must be
really hard for you to see.

271
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,958
I’ll try to be
as quiet as I can.

272
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,434
[moans]

273
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,203
- Wow, you’re evil.

274
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,572
- I totally understand if
this makes you wanna move out.

275
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:44,701
[moans]

276
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,437
- Nope, this is all okay.

277
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,312
So long as you don’t mind
sharing a bed with me.

278
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,281
Because I’m not going anywhere.

279
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,480
- Whoa, whoa, okay, okay.

280
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:58,123
So you told me you had an
exotic pet lizard to show me.

281
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,451
If there’s no ’zard,
then I’m out.

282
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,792
- This is harder
than I thought it’d be.

283
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:13,528
- Yeah. I can’t move on
while I still have feelings...

284
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,301
...for this apartment.

285
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,267
Should we give it another try?

286
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,277
- I can’t get past
all the damage I’ve done...

287
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,610
...to the living room.

288
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,085
I trashed it to piss you off,

289
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,553
but now I don’t want
to live here.

290
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:35,321
- Well, ha-ha.
You played yourself.

291
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,695
Because there’s still
a gorgeous open floor plan

292
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,664
under all this crap.
Ha-ha.

293
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:45,635
Wait, is there actual crap
in here somewhere?

294
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:48,075
It smells terrible.

295
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,096
[grunting]

296
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,806
- You need to tilt it, Bryce.

297
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,011
- Ah. Aaron, there you are, bud.

298
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,183
Bridget, this is my son Aaron.

299
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,952
Aaron, this is
the young hot woman

300
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,450
that I left your mother for
when my company went public.

301
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,223
- Cool. Whatever.

302
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,521
- Brycie, when
you said you had a son,

303
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,323
I assumed he was like, 12.

304
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:14,956
Sorry, so you’re like
young and rich?

305
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,534
- Yeah.

306
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,332
- Really appreciate you helping
out your dad there, bud.

307
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,225
- You said you’d give
me a thousand bucks.

308
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,467
Where’s my thousand bucks?

309
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,043
- A libertarian just
like his old man.

310
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,313
Bud, you mind grabbing
the other side of that?

311
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:44,893
- Wait!

312
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,034
This looks
like super heavy

313
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,260
and I’m pretty
worried about you.

314
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,764
So I should probably spot you.

315
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,656
Oh, my God, lats.

316
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,268
- Dad, your weird girlfriend
is getting in the way.

317
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,729
- Uh, Bridg, do you mind, babe?

318
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,498
- Oh, I’m sorry, Bryce.

319
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,167
Earlier you were like, "Oh,
babe, could you get me a water?

320
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,506
I’m feeling light headed."

321
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,011
And now suddenly
you don’t want my help?

322
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:08,383
Um, mucho apologies, Bryce,
but this bitch is independent.

323
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,724
Okay, everyone,
we’re lifting

324
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,519
on three, two, one.

325
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,621
Oh, my God, abs.

326
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:14,753
- Bridg.

327
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,904
- Oh, my God, Aaron, it’s like
fate that I ran into you.

328
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:33,037
Um, could you like
help me with this?

329
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,412
I think my tits are
getting in the way.

330
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,711
- Yeah, sure. Whatever.
- Thank you so much.

331
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,819
- All right,
I see what’s going on here.

332
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,920
Aaron, why don’t
you head home, bud?

333
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,451
I can take it from here.

334
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:48,587
- Whatever.

335
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,816
- Oh, my God, glutes.

336
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,828
- I’m a tech guy who ignores
the impoverished,

337
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,961
and uses his excessive wealth
to try to colonize Mars.

338
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,527
And even I couldn’t
stoop this low.

339
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,501
- Brycie, wait.

340
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:06,436
I wasn’t actually trying
to get with your...

341
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,512
- Son of a bitch!

342
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,641
- They gave the address
of a fast food joint?

343
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,746
- Okay, I’m getting
to the bottom of this.

344
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,083
- Paw Paw’s Po Boys.

345
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,484
How can we spice
up your evening?

346
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:19,786
- Those scam artists.

347
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,719

- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

- No, you’re the frauds.

351

But just out of curiosity,
how do you know we’re frauds?

352
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,235
- We took a picture
of your application

353
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,444
and called your landlord.

I’m not his landlord,
I’m his brother.

Although technically he doesn’t
even have a landlord,

359
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,646
because he just got evicted.

360
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,958
- Crazy thing is I did text him,

361
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,459
he just doesn’t
like me very much.

362

some dirt on you, too.

That is our landlord.

Paw Paw’s Po Boy.

372

Why do you think
we’re so keen to move?

- So lucky.

381
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,133
- The guy knows it’s
a shit-spot, too,

382

so he tries to sweeten
the deal

383

with free beignets
and jambalaya.

384

and the clowns will want to stay
after and hang out with us.

was on fire,

the perfect place.
